Cat and Dog Image Classifier

This project is a machine learning-based image classifier that can differentiate between images of cats and dogs. It uses a deep learning model trained on a diverse dataset of cat and dog images to make accurate predictions.

Features:
- Image Classification: Given an input image, the classifier can accurately predict whether it contains a cat or a dog.
- High Accuracy: The model has been trained on a large and diverse dataset, resulting in a high accuracy rate for classifying cat and dog images.
- Easy Integration: The classifier can be easily integrated into other applications or systems to provide cat and dog image classification capabilities.
- TensorFlow Implementation: The project utilizes the TensorFlow framework, a popular open-source library for machine learning, to train and deploy the image classifier model.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository and set up the required dependencies.
2. Provide input images of cats or dogs to the classifier.
3. The classifier will process the images and provide predictions indicating whether each image contains a cat or a dog.
